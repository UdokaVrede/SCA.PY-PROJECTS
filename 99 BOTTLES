#Initializing the variable 'bottles'
bottles=99

#outputting the values in the print statement
print('\t','There are', bottles,"green bottles standing on the wall")

#Initializing the for loop
for i in range(bottles):


#display to screen
  print('\t',bottles,"green bottles standing on the wall",'\n','\n', "If 1 green bottle should accidentally fall down?",'\n')


#reduction of the value in bottles by 1
  bottles-= 1


#condition check on bottles
  if bottles >=2:


#output if condition is true
      print('\t','There are', bottles,"green bottles standing on the wall")


#second conditional check
  elif bottles==1:


#output if condition is true
      print('\t','There is',bottles,"green bottle standing on the wall")


#if the two conditions are false, output the print statement.
